<div class="figleft" style="width: 140px;"><a href="images/289-450.png"><img src="images/289-140.png" width="140" height="119" alt="Richard Rothwell, riding on a bicycle." /></a></div>

<p class="ind1a">It has been noticed by philosophers that a mere name will often
lead a man to his ruin. Why, for example, was <span class="sc">John Darley</span> fined
twenty shillings and costs at the Tynemouth Petty Sessions? He
met a boiler-smith, <span class="sc">Richard Rothwell</span>, riding on a bicycle.
Thereupon, without any apparent
reason, he used abusive language,
bashed the unoffending boiler-smith
on the nose, brandished a
knife, and shouted out, "Come
on!&mdash;I'm <span class="sc">Johnny Darley</span>, from
Byker." There you have it. Residing,
as he did, in a perpetual
comparative, he naturally despised
and loathed the positive "byke."
Hence his violent assault on its
rider.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p class="ind">I observe, with deep regret, that
Professor <span class="sc">Lloyd</span>, of Southport, has been fined for trespassing on a
railway bridge at Preston. The Professor did not want to stay there.
All he wished to do, and all that he actually did, was to dive off into
the water below. He is an aquatic Professor, and informed the
Bench that he was obliged to do these things to keep up his reputation.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<div class="poem width21">  <div class="stanza">
<p>I'll tell you a tale of Professor <span class="sc">Lloyd</span>,</p>
<p class="i2">Who dived off a bridge at Preston&mdash;</p>
<p>An act that the magistrates much annoyed,</p>
<p class="i2">Though he kept both his coat and vest on.</p>
<p>They said "You mustn't repeat this joke,</p>
<p class="i2">Professor, or else you'll rue it."</p>
<p>But <span class="sc">Lloyd</span>, the Professor, he up and spoke,</p>
<p class="i2">And said, "I'm obliged to do it.</p>
<p>Up on the bridge I stand for awhile,</p>
<p class="i2">I stand till I fairly shiver.</p>
<p>Then down I go&mdash;it seems like a mile&mdash;</p>
<p class="i2">And I plunge in the bubbling river.</p>
<p>I hope your worships won't "queer my pitch,"</p>
<p class="i2">For I'm sorry to give you trouble</p>
<p>In maintaining a reputation which</p>
<p class="i2">Is so closely combined with bubble."</p>

<p class="ind">I wish I had been in Hawick lately. Ever since I first learnt the
rudiments of the English language I have been haunted by a desire
to know how a man looked and acted when he "bussed the
Standard." They've done that at Hawick "in connection," as I
read, "with the celebration of the ancient custom of the Common
Riding." Later on "the local slogan '<i>Teribus</i>' was sung with great
vigour." There is something crushing, scattering, and battle-heralding
about the mere sound of that fearful word.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p class="ind">J. B., who describes himself as "A Residenter in Oswald Road,"
writes to <i>The Scotsman</i> to complain of the flimsy material used in the
construction of the lamp-posts near his dwelling. The other day a
milk-van ran away&mdash;at least, the horse drawing it did. "One would
think," says J. B., "the progress of such a small vehicle would have
been arrested by coming into collision with one lamp-post, but four
posts were destroyed by the van. On examination it is found that
the foundation of a street lamp-post only goes three inches into the
stone below it. With such a short hold the lamp-post is easily
toppled over." Of course it is. To fix lamp-posts so inadequately
gives a direct encouragement to milk-vans to run away and
attempt their destruction. Let the Lord Provost of Edinburgh look
to it.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p class="ind">The Master and the Matron of the workhouse at Stratford-on-Avon
have resigned, and the guardians have been "considerably
discussing" the appointment of their successors. Eventually it was
resolved, not only to reduce the salaries, but also&mdash;hear this, ye
licensed victuallers!&mdash;to cut off the beer-money hitherto paid.
What dignity can possibly attach to a workhouse officer who has to
pay for his own beer? It is by such insidious attacks as this that
the foundations of public confidence are shaken, and the whole fabric
of the Constitution is endangered. My mind misgives me when I
attempt to forecast the future of Stratford.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p class="ind">At Tetbury there is a lodge of the recently-established Conservative
Working Men's Benefit Society. It is called&mdash;<i>absit omen</i>&mdash;the
Trouble House Lodge, and quite recently it held a <i>fête</i> and
dinner. 'Tis always <i>fête</i>-day somewhere in the world. Indeed, the
amount of <i>fêtes</i> that take place on any given day in provincial
England is astounding. Without frequent <i>fêtes</i> no district can be
considered respectable.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<div class="poem width21">  <div class="stanza">
<p>In the world that we live in our troubles are great;</p>
<p class="i2">To add to their number is scarcely the game.</p>
<p>Nay, how can these lodgers delight in their <i>fête</i>,</p>
<p class="i2">With perpetual trouble attached to their name?</p>
  </div>  </div>

<hr class="short" />

<p class="ind">At Owens College, Manchester, so I gather from the letter of
"An Old Student" in <i>The Manchester Guardian</i>, some of the
students are beginning to feel, that "while its teaching of specific
subjects is admirable, in fact, unsurpassed, its general education&mdash;that
education which consists in the development of men&mdash;has not
yet reached the same level." They therefore wish to develop
athletics, and by making the modest subscription of 10<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> compulsory
on all, "to decoy the unathletic man into taking exercise
almost without knowing it." At present only 150 out of 800 students
pay up. I heartily commend this proposal, though I confess I should
like to know what sort of exercise it is that a man can take almost
without knowing it. Let the unathletic man be decoyed by all
means, but let him thoroughly understand that he is to take exercise,
and take it, if possible, with reasonable violence.</p>

<p class="ind"><span class="sc">Mr. N. F. Druce</span>, of Cambridge, is, as I write, at the head of the
batting averages of this year, and next to him comes the marvellous
W. G.</p>

<p>Ye batsmen attend, of my hints make a use,</p>

<h2>ASCOT.</h2>

<p class="title1"><i>To Monsieur Punch.</i></p>

<p><i>Cher Monsieur</i>,&mdash;Last year I am gone to your races of Ascot. It
is beautiful, it is ravishing, but how it is dear! Thousand
thunders, how it is dear! I go to the <i>Grand Prix</i>, I pay twenty
francs, that is also dear, but it is all, it is finished. Eh well, I desire
to see one time your Gold Cup, and I go of good hour by railway.
Arrived there I pay one pound, that what you call one sov., and I
enter. I suppose I can go by all&mdash;<i>partout</i>, how say you? Ah, but
no! I see by all some <i>affiches</i> "One Pound."</p>

<p>I can to write your language enough well, but I speak with
much of difficulty. Therefore I read the affixes without nothing
to ask. Thus when I read "One Pound" I go no more far. I walk
myself in the charming garden and I see the beautiful misses. Ah
how they are adorable! <span class="sc">Daudet</span> has wrong, <span class="sc">Daudet</span> is imbecile,
they are adorable. It is not the pain to pay again some pounds for to
see to run the horses, when I can to see the misses who walk themselves
here, without to pay of more.</p>

<p>But in fine I am fatigued. Also I have great hunger, for it is the
hour of the <i>déjeuner</i>. But without doubt one is obliged to pay one
pound before to enter the bar. My word, I will not! I shall not pay
one sov., and more, for a squashed lemon and a bun of Bath. I go to
smoke at place of that, and I walk myself at the shade all near of an
arch.</p>

<p>All of a blow all the world lifts himself and comes very quick
towards me. I cannot escape, I am carried away by the crowd, I
arrive to the arch. I think "<i>Du courage, <span class="sc">Auguste</span> mon cher! Sois
calme! S'il y a encore une livre à payer&mdash;&mdash;</i>" But there is no
sov., and I pass. Thousand thunders! What is, then, this noise?
Is he a revolution, a riot of Anarchists? Ah, no! It are the bookmakers.
The bookmakers in the midst of the ladies! Hold, it is
droll! And I pay one sov. to stand with those men there! It is too
strong! I go more far, I pass the barrier, I am alone on the grass.
I go to left. I see some men, in a cage of iron, who cry also.
It is&mdash;how say you?&mdash;"Tatersal." Then, ah heaven, I arrive
at the true <i>Pesage!</i> Not of burgesses, not of villain beasts
of bookmakers, not even of "Tatersals." But <i>partout</i> the ladies
the most beautiful, the most charming, the most adorable! It is
there I go! Even if I pay one sov., two sovs., three sovs., I go!</p>

<p>I essay to enter. The policeman stops me. I say, "One pound?"
and I offer to him one sov. He looks all around, and then he says,
quite low, "No good, Sir&mdash;the inspector's looking." I say, "She is
good, that pound there, I assure you of it. Is there two to pay?"
And I hold one other. Then the inspector comes and says I bribe
the policeman. I say that no. He says that yes. I am furious.
I say I pay the entrance. He says, "Get off the course." I refuse.
He pushes me. I resist. Other policemen push me. Just heaven,
they force me to go! I cannot resist. Then all the people in face
cry furiously. They shout "Welshman!" How they are stupid!
Can they think that I am a Welshman&mdash;me, <span class="sc">Auguste</span>? Ah, that it
is droll! Then the policemen run, and I run also. I wish not to
run, but I am forced. And, in fine, we are at the railway station,
and they put me in a train, and I arrive to London at three o'clock.
See there all that I have seen of your races of Ascot, and I have
paid one sov. It costs very dear.</p>

<h3>A RULE OF CONDUCT.</h3>

<p class="center">You <i>say</i> to a man what you <i>couldn't</i> write to him; and you

<h3>SCRAPS FROM CHAPS.</h3>

<p class="ind1">A famous old mill has been burned to the ground. None other
than that situate upon the river Dee, where a certain jolly miller
sang songs and earned the envy of "bluff King <span class="sc">Hal</span>" in days of
old, wearing the white flour of a blameless life. He also wore a
white hat, for the purpose, it is said, of keeping his head warm.
The modern miller wears one in summer to keep his head cool. No
doubt he found it useful at the fire. Great thing to keep a cool
head on such occasions. The mill has now been destroyed by fire
four times. There was an ancient prophecy, according to a local
paper, that it was doomed to be burned down three times. This
Delphic oracle would, of course, have inspired the simple gentlemen
of old Greece to give up insuring after the third fire. Probably the
modern "miller of the Dee" has committed a paradox, and profited
by a lofty disregard for his prophet.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p class="ind1">All Saints Church, Old Swan, is the first Liverpool church which
has adopted the innovation of lady choristers wearing the new
surplices and caps, which have been specially designed for their
use. The surplices are quite unlike those used by the clergy; they
are more like dolmans. The caps are of the shape worn by a D.C.L.,
and are made of violet velvet. One of the most cogent reasons for
their adoption is expressed by the Rev. Canon <span class="sc">Wilkinson</span>, who,
as appears from the <i>Sheffield and Rotherham Independent</i>, writes
thus:&mdash;"Since these garments have been introduced, the offertories
in the church have been increased by at least one-third."</p>

<hr class="medium" />

<p class="ind"><span class="sc">International Discourtesy.</span>&mdash;The French law, it seems, requires
the owner of a yacht, in which he is himself sailing, to supply stores
of victual and drink for his crew. A French yacht put in at
Dartmouth, says the <i>Field</i>, and the Dartmouth Custom-house
officials darted down on her, and made the owner pay for what he
used of his own. "They manage these things better in France."
This would have been indeed, "a 'Custom' more honoured in
the breach than in the observance."</p>

<p>"They ain't on'y a lot o' sheep! I thought it was Reciters, or somethink o' that."</p></div>

<p class="ind"><span class="sc">Scene</span>&mdash;<i>A railed-in corner of the Park.</i> <span class="sc">Time</span>&mdash;<i>about</i> 7 <span class="sc">p.m.</span>
<i>Inside the inclosure three shepherds are engaged in shearing the
park sheep. The first shepherd has just thrown his patient on
its back, gripped its shoulders between his knees, and tucked its
head, as a tiresome and obstructive excrescence, neatly away
under one of his arms, while he reaches for the shears. The
second is straddled across his animal, which is lying with its
hind legs hobbled on a low stage under an elm, in a state of
stoical resignation, as its fleece is deftly snipped from under its
chin. The third operator has almost finished his sheep, which, as its
dark gray fleece slips away from its pink-and-white neck and
shoulders, suggests a rather</i> décolletée <i>dowager in the act of removing
her theatre-cloak in the stalls. Sheep, already shorn,
lie and pant in shamed and shivering bewilderment, one or two nibble
the blades of grass, as if to assure themselves that that resource is
still open to them. Sheep whose turn is still to come are penned
up at the back, and look on, scandalised, but with an air which
seems to express that their own superior respectability is a sufficient
protection against similar outrage. The shearers appear to take
a humorous view of their task, and are watched by a crowd
which has collected round the railings, with an agreeable assurance
that they are not expected to contribute towards the entertainment.</i>
</p>

<p><i>First Work-Girl</i> (<i>edging
up</i>). Whatever's goin' on
inside 'ere? (<i>After looking&mdash;disappointed.</i>)
Why, they aint on'y a lot o' sheep! I thought it was
Reciters, or somethink o' that.</p>

<p><i>Second Work-Girl</i> (<i>with
irony</i>). They <i>look</i> like Reciters,
don't they! It do
seem a shime cuttin' them

<p><i>First W. G.</i> They don't

<p><i>Second W. G.</i> I expeck they feel so ridic'lus, they 'aven't the 'art

<p><i>Lucilla</i> (<i>to</i> <span class="sc">George</span>). Do look at that one going up and sniffing at
the bundles of fleeces, trying to find out which is his. <i>Isn't</i> it
pathetic?</p>

<p><i>George.</i> H'm&mdash;puts one in mind of a shy man in a cloak-room
after a party, saying feebly, "I rather think that's <i>my</i> coat, and
there's a crush-hat of mine <i>somewhere</i> about," eh?</p>

<p><i>Lucilla</i> (<i>who is always wishing that</i> <span class="sc">George</span> <i>would talk more
sensibly</i>). Considering that sheep don't <i>wear</i> crush-hats, I hardly see
how&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>George.</i> My dear, I bow to your superior knowledge of natural
history. Now you mention it, I believe it <i>is</i> unusual. But I merely
meant to suggest a general resemblance.</p>

<p><i>Lucilla</i> (<i>reprovingly</i>). I know. And you've got into such a silly
habit of seeing resemblances in things that are perfectly different.
I'm sure I'm <i>always</i> telling you of it.</p>

<p><i>George.</i> You are, my dear. But I'm not nearly so bad as I <i>was</i>.
Think of all the things I used to compare <i>you</i> to before we were
married!</p>

<p><i>Sarah Jane</i> (<i>to her</i> Trooper). I could stand an' look on at 'em

to bring back my old 'ome that plain.</p>

<p><i>Her Trooper.</i> I'm country bred, too, though yer mightn't think
it. But there ain't much in sheep shearin' to <i>my</i> mind. If it was

<p><i>Sarah Jane.</i> Ah, that's along o' your bein' in the milingtary, I

<p><i>Tuesday.</i>&mdash;Grand night. Memorable for <i>rentrée</i> of <span class="sc">Adelina

little stranger! Absence makes hearts fonder, and so Big
Heart of Big House, crowded right up to tipmost topmost, goes out to
<span class="sc">Adelina Patti</span> reappearing
as radiant <i>Violetta</i>, the Consumptive
Cocotte and heroine of <i>La

to-night. The knowing ones observe
high keys politely transposed to suit
<span class="sc">Adelina</span>. But what
manager could refuse to <i>put down the

All come in early. Upper parts of House at Lowest
prices either breakfasted or lunched on doorstep, waiting for
Warbler to commence. Warbler begins 8.30 sharp.
"8.30 sharp" maybe, but Warbler neither sharp nor flat;
in perfect tune. <span class="sc">De Lucia</span> first rate as poor, spoony little <i>Alfredo</i>;

"<i>Pura siccome</i>," and "<i>Parigi o cara</i>," old friends all, come out as

<i>Manon's</i> niece, or first cousin. Touchingly sympathetic acting on
part of Mlle. <span class="sc">Bauermeister</span> as the nurse (draught, &amp;c., every hour,
prescriptions carefully made up) attending on the suffering soprano.
<i>Annina</i> deeply touched by sad meeting between <i>Alfred</i>, "such a

<h2>OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.</h2>

<p>"Who won the battle of Tel-el-Kebir?" "I, said Cock <span class="sc">Hamley</span>,
I won Tel-el-Kebir with my Highland Brigade." Mr. <span class="sc">Innes Shand's</span>
life of General Sir <span class="sc">E. B. Hamley</span> (<span class="sc">Blackwood</span>) is obviously published
with chief intent of placing in permanent form <span class="sc">Hamley's</span>
claim in respect of this engagement. It is not a new story. It was
published to the world soon after the event in the pages of a
monthly magazine. The article, a model of terse, lucid, yet picturesque
writing, is reproduced in these volumes. Whether accurate
in detailed assertion and induction, or coloured by strong feeling, it
is a melancholy story. Either <span class="sc">Hamley</span> was deliberately ignored in
the Commander-in-Chief's despatches after Tel-el-Kebir, or he was
under a remarkable hallucination. The affair is all the more curious
since Sir <span class="sc">Garnet Wolseley</span>, as soon as he was appointed to the
Egyptian command, sought out <span class="sc">Hamley</span> and offered him the command
of one of the divisions of the expeditionary force. The secret of the
estrangement which soon developed between the two soldiers is, my
Baronite suspects, to be found in the characteristic fact that the very
day the ship conveying Sir <span class="sc">Garnet Wolseley</span> arrived at Alexandria,
<span class="sc">Hamley</span> went on board and proposed to show his chief how the enemy
should be attacked. "He did not seem to wish to pursue the subject,"
<span class="sc">Hamley</span> writes in his diary, "and I soon after took leave." Other
incidents, which <span class="sc">Hamley</span> hotly resented, culminated in the despatch
to the War Office reporting the fight at Tel-el-Kebir, and ignoring
the Highland Brigade, which, in the view of its commander, had borne
the brunt of the battle. Some day Lord <span class="sc">Wolseley</span> may give his
version of the affair. Meantime it gloomily stands forth in this
record of a strenuous but, on the whole, a disappointed life. It is
pleasant to learn that <span class="sc">Hamley</span> gratefully recognised in one of
<i>Mr. Punch's</i> Cartoons a powerful incentive to the course of public
feeling which postponed his being shelved under the operation of the
scheme of compulsory retirement by reason of age. The most
charming passages in the book are the correspondence with the late
Mr. <span class="sc">Blackwood</span>, who opened to General <span class="sc">Hamley</span> the avenue to
literary fame.</p>

<p>One of my Baronites of Irish extraction writes thusly:&mdash;"<i>A Tale
of the Thames</i> is the title of the Summer Number of <i>The Graphic</i>.
It is written by <span class="sc">J. Ashby-Sterry</span>, and illustrated by <span class="sc">William
Hatherell</span>. The course of the story&mdash;or, rather, the watercourse of
the story&mdash;covers a good deal of ground, embracing as it does, on
both sides, most places of interest between the Source in Trewsbury
Mead, Gloucestershire, and Hampton Court." Quoth the Baron, "I
am all anxiety to see this tale of the Thames uncoil itself."</p>

<p>The Baron welcomes a comparatively "handy" volume ("handy"
relative term, depending on size of hand) of reference, entitled, <i>Men
and Women of the Time</i>, new edition, brought out by Messrs.
<span class="sc">George Routledge</span>, edited by Mr. <span class="sc">Plarr</span> of Oxford; and the <i>plat</i>
that is set before the public and the Baron appears to be a thoroughly
satisfying one. "The first name for which I naturally looked,"
quoth the Baron, "was that of <span class="sc">Routledge</span> himself, but searching
from <span class="sc">Rossi</span>, through Roumania, to <span class="sc">Rowbotham</span>, nowhere did I light
upon the name of <span class="sc">Routledge</span>. Master <span class="sc">Millais</span> is here, also <span class="sc">Miller</span>,
likewise <span class="sc">Mills</span>; but I do not see the name of the author of the
<i>'Arry Papers</i>, the inventor of <span class="sc">'Arry</span> in these columns, of immortal
fame. "Name him!" In every other respect the compilers and
publishers are to be congratulated, and do hereby stand congratulated,
on their work by the ever-appreciative</p>

<h3>"A SALE! A SALE!"</h3>

<p>The Price Sale of pictures on Saturday last at Christie's will be
ever memorable as "The Highest Price Sale." "'What's the demd
total?' was the first question <i>Mr. Mantilini</i> asked." To which the
present answer is £87,144. A nice little sum to go on with, or off
with. One of the incidents was most dramatic. <span class="sc">Gainsborough's</span>
"<i>Lady Musgrave</i>" was put up to be purchased. Then stood forward
bold <span class="sc">William Agnew</span> with eight thousand guineas in his best
gossamer. "The lady is mine!" he exclaimed, rapturously, and
was advancing with arms outstretched to seize his prize, when suddenly
his path was crossed by one <span class="sc">Campbell</span> "of that ilk," who cried
aloud, "Here are ten thousand golden sovereigns <i>plus</i> ten thousand
silver shillings, all glittering on a tray! Advance no further!"
And bold <span class="sc">William</span> advanced no further. For once he was taken
aback. "I didna ken the <span class="sc">Campbell</span> was coming!" muttered
<span class="sc">William</span> A-bashed. And ere he could recover from his surprise,
and while yet his frame was quivering with excitement, his picture,
the Lady that should have been his, was gone. "They have given
her to another!" he sang sadly, but the next moment he pulled
himself together, and "taking heart of Grace" <span class="sc">William</span> made such
running, off his own bat, as would have astonished even the eminent
cricketer just mentioned. And the last of the "Reynolds' Miscellany"
in this collection succumbed to <span class="sc">William</span> the Conqueror for
450 guineas. <i>Sic transit gloria Saturday!</i></p>

<h2>A FINE SUMMER DAY'S OUTING.</h2>

<p>Highly recommended by "The Faculty" (who has tried it more
than once). Given a perfectly calm sea, a delicious light breeze, and
anything else "given" that you can get, including pleasant company,
then, with tears in your patriotic eyes, and a tremolo in your voice,
bid farewell (for a couple of hours or so) to old England, cross the
Channel, invade France <i>viâ</i> Calais, where, however calm the sea has
been, you must be prepared for a "buffet"; but this "buffet" is
not at all rough, just the contrary, and if by chance you should
have at all suffered from any unevenness in the wave line, you are
sure, on arriving at Calais, of a "restauration" which will send
you back in another hour and a half quite the giant refreshed.
That same evening you can pose as a real traveller just returned
from "the Continent," which will serve you excellently both as
reason and apology for not having answered any letters, and neglected
epistolary business generally during the last month. "Been away,
my boy!" "Ah, that's why you didn't answer my letter. Where
have you been?" "Oh! France, about Normandy. Delightful.
Ta! Ta!" And perhaps the expenditure of the day's trip will have
saved you from all sorts of trouble, pecuniary and otherwise, that
you might have got into had you remained at home, answering
letters. <i>But</i>, as to the benefit of the sea air&mdash;there can't be two
opinions about <i>that</i>.</p>

<p>But as <span class="sc">Jemmy</span> has shirked it for tosh on "ethereal mildness," and such,</p>

<h2>WHITEWASHING THE STATUE OF CROMWELL.</h2>

<p class="ind">"<span class="sc">Cromwell</span>," wrote the <i>Daily News</i> on <span class="sc">Arthur Balfour's</span>
speech, "was the only man of his time who understood the principles
of religious freedom." Ahem!</p>

<p>"Papa," said <i>Polly Eccles</i>, referring to certain charges brought
against her revered father, "Papa may have his faults, but he's a
<i>very</i> clever man." So the <i>D. N.</i> as to the Protector <span class="sc">Cromwell</span>.
"<span class="sc">Oliver</span>," says the <i>D. N.</i> in effect, "being human, may have had
his faults, as had other men of his time, but he thoroughly understood
religious freedom." Did he? In Ireland for example? With him
"religious freedom" was like the verb in grammar, either "expressed"
or "understood." It might have been "understood," but
it certainly was not "expressed" in action. If <span class="sc">Cromwell</span> was such
a model of "religious freedom," then it will be as well to reconsider
history under <span class="sc">Nero</span>, <span class="sc">Diocletian</span>, <span class="sc">&amp; Co.</span>, not to mention the amiable
Ninth <span class="sc">Charles</span> of France, the genial <span class="sc">Harry the Eighth</span> of England,
the gentle <span class="sc">Peter</span>, Czar of all the Russia, and a few other kindly-disposed
rulers, who were, probably, the only men of their time thoroughly
understanding the principles of religious freedom. As the song says,
"They wouldn't ha' 'urt a biby, They were men as you could trust!"
And for <span class="sc">Oliver</span> himself, "He was all right when you knew him, <i>But</i>&mdash;you
had to know him fust!" Rather; and then you had to accommodate
yourself to his little ways, or else so much the worse for one of
the two, and that one wouldn't have been <span class="sc">Oliver Cromwell</span>. But, of
course, between principles and practise there is a "Great Divide."</p>

<hr class="medium" />

<p class="ind1"><span class="sc">The Shahzada</span>, weary of London life and English enjoyment, will at
last exclaim with the canny Scot, "For pleasure gie me Peebles!" (The
original remark was made by the author of <i>Peebles whom I have met</i>.)</p>

<h2 class="sans">ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.</h2>

<p class="center2">EXTRACTED FROM THE DIARY OF TOBY, M.P.</p>

<p><i>House of Commons, Monday, June 10.</i>&mdash;School reopened after
Whitsun Holidays. Occasion marked by lamentable episode.
Attendance, as usual on Black Monday, very small. <span class="sc">Speaker</span> took
Chair at three o'clock. No
private business on hand;
nothing to be done till
half-past three. Meanwhile,
<span class="sc">Speaker</span> and Members
sit with hands folded.</p>

<p>Everyone knows the
temptation of such opportunity
for a nameless
Personage. <span class="sc">Tommy's</span>
idle hands instinctively
clutched after mischief.
Suppose he were to move
to have House counted?
Evidently not forty present;
nothing very serious
would follow. <span class="sc">Speaker</span>
would count. If not forty
on hand, would leave
Chair, sit at table, and
wait till they came. Or
he would go off, come back
any time before four when
message brought in that a
quorum was in sight.
Still, it would be a lark;
would startle the House,
frighten Ministers, possibly
postpone commencement of
business by half an hour.</p>

<p>Cap'en just rising with intent to observe that there are not forty
Members present, when happier thought struck him. Why not get
some landsman to do the trick? The more venerable and venerated
the agent the better. <span class="sc">Tommy</span> knows himself
to be a wicked old salt. House not shocked
now at anything he does. Half the fun gone
if he played this prank himself. Shifting
his quid and scanning horizon, noted in his
place Sir <span class="sc">Richard Temple</span>, Bart., G.C.S.I.,
late Lieutenant-Governor of Bengal, once
Governor of Bombay, sometime Chief Commissioner
of Central Provinces of India.</p>

<p>The very man for the job. Buttonholing
him with his hook, Cap'en <span class="sc">Tommy</span> opened
his little plot. <span class="sc">Temple</span> aghast at first.
Never known such a thing done, and the like.
<span class="sc">Tommy</span> jawed away, twisting <span class="sc">Temple</span> round
the tip of his hook like a marlingspike on a
flying jibboom. Convinced him that public
duty called for sacrifice of private prejudices.
Having squared <span class="sc">Temple</span>, <span class="sc">Tommy</span> got men
near him to walk out before House was
counted, so as to reduce chances of quorum.</p>

<p>Bell rang; Members rushed in; Ministers
huddled on Treasury Bench like flock of
frightened sheep. <span class="sc">Tommy</span>, looking down
from shrouds in Strangers' Gallery, carefully
counted.</p>

<p>"Only thirty two," he said. "Done it!"</p>

<p>But <span class="sc">Speaker</span> can count as well. "One-two&mdash;four&mdash;fourteen&mdash;twenty-seven&mdash;thirty-nine,
forty," said he, with tone of conviction
that precluded contradiction.</p>

<p>"Blow me tight!" said <span class="sc">Tommy</span>, coming
out of the shrouds, a deathly pallor shining
through his tan. That was not his exact
expression; but it was equivalent to his
remark.</p>

<p><i>Business done.</i>&mdash;Quite a lot.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;"><a href="images/300a-1150.png"><img src="images/300a-600.png" width="600" height="428" alt="Vantage in (Sir E. Gr-y and Sir E. Ashm-d-B-rtl-tt.)" /></a>
<p class="center2">Vantage in (Sir E. Gr-y and Sir E. Ashm-d-B-rtl-tt.)</p></div>

<p><i>Tuesday.</i>&mdash;<span class="sc">Edward Grey</span> is a hard nut for
Irresponsible Verbosity to crack. <span class="sc">Silomio</span>,
his jaws aching with attempts at crunching
<span class="sc">Sydney Buxton</span>, sometimes turns to him,
and goes away sorrowing. <span class="sc">Tommy</span> has a tuck in at him occasionally,
but makes nothing of the job. To night <span class="sc">Ambrose</span>, Q.C., took him
in hand. Drew up stupendous question on subject of Great Britain's
relations with the Porte in respect of Armenia.</p>

<p>"That'll fetch him," he said, as he ogled the paper on which the
question was set forth in bold type. Is there a treaty obligation,
he wanted to know, as distinguished from mere discretionary right,
authorising Great Britain to interfere in the affairs of Armenia, or
make war upon the Porte? If so, specify the treaty and the particular
article or articles creating such obligation.</p>

<p>This a bare summary of question, the drafting of which had cost
<span class="sc">Ambrose, Q.C.</span>, some sleepless nights. <span class="sc">Silomio</span> had looked over it;
<span class="sc">Tommy</span> had touched it up; <span class="sc">Bartley</span> had beamed over it; <span class="sc">Hanbury</span>
had hugged it. <span class="sc">Grey's</span>
last hour (of course in Parliamentary sense) had
evidently come. He had wriggled out of some
earlier man traps set for him. This would settle him.</p>

<p>And this is what <span class="sc">Grey</span> said in reply:&mdash;"The
article of the Treaty of Berlin relative to the point
raised by the hon. member is the sixty-first."</p>

<p>Only that, and nothing more. The raven on the
pallid bust of <span class="sc">Pallas</span> was
scarcely more disappointingly laconic. There was
a shocked pause; then allied forces swooped down
on <span class="sc">Under Secretary</span>, crying, in chorus. Did
the clause mean this? Did it mean that?</p>

<p>"The hon. member," said <span class="sc">Grey</span>, not even smiling,
"must place his own interpretation on the clause."</p>

<p>Evidently nothing to be done with a person of this temperament.
<span class="sc">Silomio</span>, with a wild shriek, learned in Swaziland, dashed in with
fresh questions; was neatly tripped up by <span class="sc">Speaker</span>; lay sprawling
on ground with dishevelled hair. Before he
could get up, <span class="sc">Snape</span> was asking <span class="sc">Home
Secretary</span> if the police might not be supplied
with lighter clothing in summer months.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 180px;"><a href="images/300b-600.png"><img src="images/300b-180.png" width="180" height="331" alt="Don Currie, Lord High Admiral." /></a>
<p class="clear">Don Currie, Lord High Admiral.</p></div>

<p><i>Business done.</i>&mdash;Crofters Bill read second time.</p>

<p><i>Wednesday. Off Tilbury.</i>&mdash;Yes, I'm off
Tilbury, and shall be off to the Baltic at four
bells, whatever time that may be. Mr. G. is
responsible for it. Tired of doing nothing;
pondering perilously over growing temptation
to run up to town, plunge into Parliamentary
work; address meeting at Blackheath on
Armenian question. In nick of time comes
letter from <span class="sc">Don Currie</span>, proposing a trip to
Kiel for opening of Baltic Canal.</p>

<p>"The very thing!" said Mr. G., vaulting
over the library table at Hawarden, where he
was sitting when letter arrived. "But <span class="sc">Toby,
M.P.</span>, must come with us."</p>

<p>Objections urged in vain. What would
Constituents in Berks say, me running away
from work? Who was to write the only
authentic matter-of-fact record of Parliamentary
doings for future historians? Mr. G.,
with all the impetuosity of youth, would listen
to nothing. So here I am, onboard the R.M.S.
<i>Tantallon Castle</i>. Here, also, is quite a quorum
of members. Curious to see how they all
trooped in just now when luncheon-bell rang.
Said they thought it was a division; being
in saloon, might as well stay.</p>

<p>That's all very well. By-and-by we'll
be on the North Sea, where the stormy winds
do blow, do blow. Shall see <i>then</i> whether
we can keep a House through the dinner
hour.</p>

<p><i>Business done.</i>&mdash;Anchor weighed. Mr. G.
taking the helm till we're out in the open,
when anyone can steer. Looks more than usually knowing in a
sou'wester. Wind N.S.E. Barometer falling.</p>

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
